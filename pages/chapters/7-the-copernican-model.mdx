Chapter 7: The Copernican model is geometrically impossibile
============================================================


We have often heard that the heliocentric and geocentric models are equally valid and viable, i.e. that they're just "two sides of the same coin" - and that "it's only a question of perspective & point of view". However, there can only be one correct interpretation of our celestial mechanics and geometry that unfailingly predicts for _all_ the interactions between our Solar System’s companions vis-à-vis each other - AND the more distant stars. Through sound logic, induction and deductive reasoning (“à-la-Sherlock Holmes”) we should be able to discard the impossible hypotheses and retain the sole configuration which makes physical, geometrical and optical sense - while being consistent at all times with _empirical observation_.

And here is where the Copernican theory miserably falls apart. As you will see, what follows categorically disqualifies the Copernican model as a viable proposition, since its proposed cosmic geometry isn’t only problematic or questionable: it is outright impossible, unless you contrive fantastical new laws of nature to excuse it (as, in fact, the likes of Kepler and Einstein resorted to do). I shall expound and illustrate this in the present Chapter with, so-to-speak, 'a little help from Mars'. 


**CASSINI'S DETERMINATION OF MARS'S PARALLAX AGAINST THE STARS**

Before proceeding, I must remind the readers about the famous astronomical enterprise of Giovanni Cassini and his colleague Jean Richer. Here goes:

> _"In 1672, [Cassini] sent his colleague Jean Richer to Cayenne, French Guiana, while he himself stayed in Paris. The two made simultaneous observations of Mars and, by computing the parallax, determined its distance from Earth. This allowed for the first time an estimation of the dimensions of the solar system: since the relative ratios of various sun-planet distances were already known from geometry, only a single absolute interplanetary distance was needed to calculate all of the distances."_ [Wikipedia - Giovanni Cassini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini)

Here's a simple diagram (from a French astronomy website) illustrating Cassini's ingenious observational experiment:

![](http://septclues.com/TYCHOS/Mars_Parallax_Cassini_Richer_01.jpg)

In short: Cassini and Richer compared their simultaneous observations of Mars (from two earthly locations separated by only 7000 kilometers) and, thanks to the PARALLAX exhibited by Mars against the starry background (and using simple trigonometry), they determined Mars's distance from Earth. 

Now, of prime interest to our current discourse is that these mere 7000 kilometers of separation between two earthly observers (Cassini and Richer) caused Mars to be noticeably - and measurably - displaced against the distant starry background. In other words, Cassini and Richer observed Mars (simultaneously) aligning with _different_ stars. Let us now imagine that the two astronomers had not been stationed just 7000km apart but, say, _300-million-km_ apart; surely, as they both observed Mars's specific position on a given day, they would have recorded a MUCH larger parallax (than they did in reality). Agreed? If so, let us get on.  


**HOW CAN MARS RETURN FACING THE SAME STAR IN ONLY 546 DAYS?**

Here are two successive conjunctions of Mars with a given star - as observed and documented in recent years:
- On November 5, 2018 - Mars conjuncted with the star **Delta Capricorni (_a.k.a._ “Deneb Algedi”)**. 
- On May 4, 2020 - (i.e. _546 days_ later) Mars again conjuncted with that very same star. <br/>
>(Note: BOTH of these conjunctions occurred as Mars was transiting at 21h47min of Right Ascension - or celestial longitude)

Now, here's the thing: according to the Copernican model, after 546 days (or ca. 1½ years), Earth would find itself on the opposite side of its (supposed) 300-million-km-wide orbit. So the question becomes: how can this possibly be reconciled with what is shown by 3-D simulators of the standard heliocentric model?  

There are two types of modern Copernican simulators we may take astronomical data from. One attempts to simulate the orbital motions of our planets and moons (such as the [JS ORRERY](https://mgvez.github.io/jsorrery/) or the [SCOPE planetarium](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/) which both feature an “outer-space” 3-D view of our solar system - as if we were looking at it from a spaceship. The other type of planetariums (such as [STELLARIUM](https://stellarium-web.org/) or the now defunct NEAVE planetarium) are far more realistic and verifiable, as they simulate our stars’ and planets’ positions just as we can observe them from our backyard. Bear this in mind in the following comparison.

The two below pairs of screenshots (from the SCOPE and NEAVE planetariums) compare the positions of Earth and Mars on two given dates separated by 546 days (ca. 1½ years). In this time interval, both Earth and Mars would have (**according to the Copernican model**) moved laterally by about 300 Mkm. Yet, on _both_ of these dates, an earthly observer will see Mars neatly aligned with star Delta Capricorni! 

**How can this possibly occur in reality (as it does) if the Copernican model were true?**

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/028_SCOPE_NEAVE_Mars_in%20Capricorn_compared_03.jpg)

In order to put this problem in due perspective, let's take a look at a classic explanation for the observed retrograde motion of Mars:

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/029_Retrograde_in_Copernican_universe.jpg)

Note that this particular parallax issue (the nearby Mars's parallax in relation to a given star) should not be confused with the historical - and still ongoing - controversy regarding stellar parallax (that is, the nigh-undetectable parallax between _nearby and more distant stars_, which we shall explore in depth later on). 

To summarize the above considerations, we may formulate the following general statement: 

**How Mars can reconjunct with a given star after only 546 days (whereas it 'normally' does so in about 707 days) is NOT something that can be reconciled - under the currently-known, earthly laws of Nature - with the geometric configuration of the heliocentric Copernican model.**

On the other hand, the TYCHOS model provides a plain, simple and demonstrable explanation for this 'mysterious' behavior of Mars. I will now guide you step by step through the 15-year period of Mars during which it realigns with a given star 7 times in 707 days and the 8th time around, in only 546 days. Let's start with the latter, shorter period (known as Mars's SHORT ESI - or Empiric Sidereal Interval). 

The below diagram shows how Mars can return to the same celestial longitude in only 546 days:  

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/MARS_DENEBALGEDI_546days_Tychos_01.jpg)

As you can see, the 546-day period occurs when Mars's spirographic orbital pattern (which has it realigning with a given star every 707 days on 7 successive occasions) 'closes' earlier, the 8th time around. This, because as Mars returns to a given celestial longitude "X" for the 8th time, it will still be short of its biyearly retrograde loop and will therefore transit at vector "X" earlier than its previous 7 revolutions. It's just plain geometry.

As mentioned in Chapter 5, Mars returns to face a given star over a 15-year cycle in this rather curious sequence:

707 days ‒ 707 days ‒ 707days ‒ 707days ‒ 707days ‒ 707days ‒ 707days ‒ **546 days**

That’s right: Mars returns facing the same star for seven successive intervals of 707 days, followed by a far shorter interval of 546 days. 

You will now rightfully ask: _Is this what is ACTUALLY observed? And does the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator confirm this bizarrely irregular behavior of Mars?"_   

The answer is 'yes' to both questions. 
Here’s the observed sequence of Mars conjuncting with the star Deneb Algedi - between the years 2005 and 2020 (i.e. a 15-year Mars cycle):

|          | 2005-04-22 |
|----------|:----------:|
|+706 days | 2007-03-29 |
|+709 days | 2009-03-07 |
|+710 days | 2011-02-15 |
|+710 days | 2013-01-25 |
|+709 days | 2015-01-04 |
|+707 days | 2016-12-11 |
|+694 days | 2018-11-05 |
|**+546 days** | 2020-05-04 |

And here's how the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator accounts for these 9 transits of Mars at about 21h47m of RA (i.e. the celestial longitude of the star Deneb Algedi):

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/MARS_DENEBALGEDI_15YEARS_new.jpg)

We see that, in the Tychosium 3D simulator, all of these Mars transits - at 21h47m of RA - occur on the very same line of sight towards star Deneb Algedi. And this, in spite of the last one (of 2020-05-04) taking place only 546 days after the previous one (of 2018-11-05). 

In stark contast, here's how the Copernican JS ORRERY simulator depicts these same 9 transits of Mars _"as it conjuncts (?) with star Deneb Algedi"_:

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/MARS_DENEBALGEDI_15YEARS_JSorrery.jpg)

Note that all of these Mars-Deneb Algedi conjunctions, as viewed from Earth, indeed occur when Mars finds itself at 21h47m of right ascension (RA) in our skies - although Earth would find itself each time in a wholly different location. So how could this possibly happen, if the Copernican model is correct? To wit, how could Mars conjunct with Deneb Algedi on both 2018-11-05 and 2020-05-04, two dates between which Earth and Mars would have moved “sideways” (or perpendicularly in relation to that star) by about 300 million km? It matters little how distant that star is from us; what matters is that Mars is far closer to us than that star.

Now, Copernican astronomers will tell you that this is indeed a matter of the star being so vastly distant, so that this 'tiny' 300Mkm displacement has no effect on the line of sight towards it. They will also argue that those 9 lines (in the above graphic) are perhaps not quite parallel. Fine, they may have a point. Yet, consider this: if you are prone to agree with their objections, you would then have to dismiss what is shown in the Tychosium 3D simulator (what with ALL of these 9 conjunctions occurring on the _exact same line of sight_ towards Deneb Algedi) as being some sort of 'extraordinary coincidence'. At the end of the day, it is up to you to decide which model (the Copernican or the TYCHOS) provides the most sensible explanation for the observed behavior of Mars. 

**THE EXTREMELY RARE TRIPLE CONJUNCTIONS OF MARS WITH A GIVEN STAR**

In order to verify the accuracy of the Tychosium 3D simulator, I have often used the Star Atlas (another Copernican solar system simulator) as a “control reference”. The below table (which compares the Mars-Deneb Algedi conjunctions between the year 1900 and 2099) shows just how well the two simulators agree. 

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/Mars_Deneb_Algedi_conjunctiontables_02.jpg) 

But wait! What do we see happening in the year 2050? Well, in 2050 we will see a **TRIPLE** conjunction of Mars and star Deneb Algedi (unfolding over a 117-day timespan). The question is: WHY? How could such a triple conjunction possibly occur in the Copernican model? And if Mars gets overtaken by Earth (every 2.13 years or so), why wouldn't such triple conjunctions be observed each and every time that Earth overtakes Mars? One thing is certain: the Copernican model has no rational explanation for these rare events. On the other hand, the Tychosium 3D simulator provides a clear-cut, graphic explanation for the odd occurrence of triple conjunctions of Mars with a given star. What will happen in 2050 is that Mars's 'retrograde loop' will then be almost perfectly centered  around the line-of-sight vector joining Earth and Deneb Algedi. This will cause Mars to conjunct with that star on three occasions (A - B - C), within only 117 days. 
My below screenshots from the Tychosium simulator describe this better than a thousand words ever could:

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/Mars_DenebAlgedi_TRIPLE_conjunctions_03.jpg)

As you can see, in 2050 Mars will be retrograding precisely 'in front of' star Deneb Algedi.

You may now wish to verify all of the above for yourself by perusing the [TYCHOSIUM 3D Planetarium.](https://ts.tychos.space/)

### The impossible (Copernican) 816-day re-conjunction of Earth and Venus with a given star 

We shall now take a look at Venus. We will compare two screenshots from the SCOPE planetarium depicting two conjunctions of Earth and Venus with star Regulus (in the Leo constellation) occurring within an interval of 816 days (or 2.234 years). In that time period, according to the Copernican model, Earth and Venus would both displace themselves laterally (i.e. _perpendicularly_ to Regulus' celestial location) by about 200 million kilometers. Yet, Venus was actually observed to conjunct with star Regulus on both of these dates (2018-07-10 and 2020-10-03). How can the Copernican model possibly account for these empirical observations?

**Two screenshots from the SCOPE simulator:**

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/031_Scope_VENUS_in_LEO_816days_comparison_02.jpg)

Copernican astronomers will tell you that the reason why this would occur is that the stars are so immensely distant that these two ostensibly PARALLEL lines of sight (towards Venus and Regulus) are "perhaps not QUITE parallel" and will thus somehow ultimately converge towards star Regulus. Now, we may debate this question of parallelism (or non-parallelism) until the cows come home - but these empirically-observed and documented facts remain: Venus did indeed conjunct with star Regulus on those two dates.

The NEAVE planetarium which simulates realistically what we can actually observe in our skies (from our backyard) confirms that Venus and Regulus indeed conjuncted at both ends of our chosen 816-day period example (2018-07-10 --> 2020-10-03):

**Two screenshots from the NEAVE simulator:**

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/032_Neave_VENUS_in_LEO_816days_comparison_01.jpg)

Once more, the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator can demonstrate just how and why Venus _will indeed physically return facing a given star in 816 days_:

**Two superimposed screenshots from the TYCHOSIUM simulator:**

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/033_VENUS_Regulus_816days.jpg)

As you can see, in the TYCHOS model Venus will _physically_ return to the same celestial longitude - and will therefore re-conjunct with star Regulus after an 816-day interval (as accurately shown by the Tychosium 3D simulator). Again, the reader is the judge as to which model makes more sense: 

- **The Copernican model** has Venus returning facing the same star after 816 days even though, during this time period, Earth & Venus would both have moved 'sideways' by about 200 million kilometers). 

- **The TYCHOS model** has Venus naturally reconjuncting with that same star - simply because it _physically_ returns to that same celestial longitude!

### COMETS NEVER EXHIBIT RETROGRADE MOTIONS

_**"Tycho Brahe already refuted the Copernican system"**_

The above sentence is the title of a [short essay](http://zbawienienews.blogspot.com/2014/09/tycho-brahe-already-refuted-copernican.html) by a Polish blogger, "Zbawienie". In the paper, the author cites a few extracts from _"The Contradictions in Astronomy (1869)"_ by Carl Schöpffer, a book that I have so far been unable to find. Zbawienie's paper starts with these words:   

> _"According to the testimony of today's astronomers Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) was one of the greatest astronomers ever. Kepler was his employee. Tycho Brahe postulated a world system of his own and fought against the Copernican with good reason. Now this is odd and certainly there is a special reason for the fact that in the later works of astronomers to this day, although the Ptolemaic world view is described in detail, Tycho Brahe's system is either not mentioned at all, or dismissed with a few meaningless words. Those reasons for the rejection of the Copernican system by Tycho Brahe, which are believed to have been invalidated successfully today, are being addressed at great length in modern books on astronomy. **But the main reason of Tycho Brahe opposing Copernicanism is not mentioned anywhere. Unfortunately the astronomers succeeded in ignoring him completely".**_ (Zbawienie's own bolds)

Zbawienie then proceeds to describe how the comets are never observed to retrograde - as all our surrounding planets do. This is indeed a documented observational fact that no earnest astronomer can deny. However, it would appear that this fact (which all by itself falsifies the Copernican theory for our planets' retrograde motions) has been all but suppressed from astronomy literature or, in any case, from the internet search engines. Carl Schöpffer (a geocentrist) was a prolific, polyhedric German writer and the author of "The Earth Stands Fast". Unsurprisingly perhaps, Schöpffer is often dismissed as a 'kook and a charlatan' by, so-to-speak, "official" sources. Be it as it may, he was evidently proficient in astronomical matters - and well-versed in the observed cometary motions. Here follows an excerpt from his 1869 treatise, _"The Contradictions in Astronomy"_:         

> _"All comets retain their course unchanged, are either immutably prograde or immutably retrograde.(...) Tycho had also observed these peculiarities of comets, but had also immediately drawn the conclusion from them that the adopted movement of the earth must be a false conclusion, because otherwise it would have to exert an influence on the apparent motion of the comets. (...) "In addition to that, two comets, which came into opposition with the sun, showed apparently enough, that the earth in fact does not move, because their adopted motion had no effect on the previously calculated and even course of the latter, as is the case with planets, of which Copernik says that they would retrograde for this reason. Later on there has often occured an occasion in which comets could be observed long enough to become convinced of their inconsistency with the Copernican system. The Great Comet of 1811 was observed 511 days, 359 days the comet of 1825, 286 days Halley in 1835 and 269 days the Great Comet of 1858 - but with all of them the course in the sky was an even one, **no semblance of deviation was brought about by the assumed orbit of the earth.**(...) How is it, then, that in the textbooks on astronomy only those of Tycho's pleas against the Copernican system, which arose from the ignorance of his time with physical things, are mentioned and refuted with unnecessary garrulity, whilst this strong objection is carefully concealed or only superficially touched?"_

As we shall see further on (in Chapter 29 and 30), the fact that both comets and near-earth asteroids exhibit **no - or extremely small** retrograde motions squarely contradicts the Copernican theory for our planets' observed retrograde periods. The heliocentric model is therefore, quite simply, a geometrical impossibility. 

****************************************************************************************************************************

In the next chapter, we shall take a deeper look into the Sun's two moons: Venus and Mercury. _"What? The Sun's 'two moons'?..."_ Yes. As we shall see, Venus and Mercury are unquestionably the Sun's two lunar satellites - without a shadow of doubt.
